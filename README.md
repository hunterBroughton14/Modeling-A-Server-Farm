# Sudoku Solver Project - Depth-First Search Algorithm, Stack Data Structure
Welcome to the Sudoku Solver Project! This project is a showcase of implementing a stack-based depth-first search algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles. It provides a unique blend of algorithmic strategy with one of the most popular puzzle games in the world.

## Overview
This project involves developing a Sudoku solver using a stack-based, depth-first search algorithm. Unlike traditional methods, this approach simulates a more human-like process in solving Sudoku puzzles. The solver is capable of handling puzzles of varying difficulty levels, offering insights into how the number of pre-filled cells affects the complexity of the solving process.

## Key Features
+ **Depth-First Search Algorithm**: Utilizes a stack-based approach to explore potential solutions, ensuring efficiency and speed.
+ **Complexity Analysis**: Examines how the initial number of filled cells in a Sudoku puzzle influences the complexity of finding a solution.
+ **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an easy way for users to input Sudoku puzzles and receive solutions.
+ **Flexibility**: Capable of solving puzzles of various difficulty levels, from beginner to expert.
+ **Educational Tool**: An excellent resource for those interested in learning about depth-first search algorithms and their applications in real-world problems.
Getting Started

## Getting Started 
To dive into this simulation, simply clone the repository, run the Sudoku.java file in your command line, and input your Sudoku puzzle in the specified format. The solver will process the puzzle and return the solution or indicate if the puzzle is unsolvable. I encourage experimentation and modification to understand the depth-first search algorithm better and its application in solving Sudoku puzzles.
